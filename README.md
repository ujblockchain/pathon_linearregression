# SARChI - Python: Linear Regression
South Africa-Switzerland Bilateral Research Chair in Blockchain Technology aims to explore blockchain integrations with real-world applications and development in Agric-food.

## Context
As a research center, our focus is more than just blockchain technology, but we have expertise in web development, data analysis, data science, and machine learning development. In this repository, look at a popular algorithm used in machine learning solutions, regression. We introduce **linear regression** and the mathematics behind the algorithm. We use the fundamental gained from our [Machine Learning with Python](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYAUzWboAWPgPbusvNP1vBEHMM_HeOne5&si=_z1VLO3O_7vmCnZ7), and apply linear regression to determine the price of an Uber/Lyft trip. 

## Dataset
The dataset used for the linear regression demonstration is [Uber & Lyft Cab Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravi72munde/uber-lyft-cab-prices). 

## Methods
In the notebook, we analyse Uber and Lyft ride-hailing data from Boston, United States of America. Prices of ride hailing services fluctuate regularly due to factors such like demand-bursts or availability constraints, therefore we dive into the dataset to uncover relationships that influence the price of a trip.
